AggyS1coOb8_1, I went over the four main product types along with her down payments and seller's concession in this video we're going to take a look into the conventional loan for a single-family home so if you see here we have a minimum down payment of three percent now that is if you are a first time homebuyer or have not had a property interest in a home in the past three years you can qualify for that three percent otherwise you're looking at a five percent down payment at minimum and then we have a three percent seller's concession now that's if you're putting anywhere from three percent to ten percent down if you put ten percent to twenty percent down the seller's concession goes up to six percent and any more than twenty percent it goes all the way up to nine percent that's a great feature of the conventional loan we have a minimum FICO score here of 620 gift funds get funds are allowed and two months of reserves so that means two months of a pity payment or mortgage Payment principal interest taxes and insurance so that's after your down payment and closing costs you're going to need to have at least two months of mortgage payment for reserves and then your mortgage insurance varies now what's great about the conventional loan is that the mortgage insurance goes away after you pay down twenty-two percent of the home so you have a seventy-eight percent LTV or once you have to twenty percent mark you can get your home assessed our appraised and if there's enough equity in the home they will take away the mortgage insurance or you can just put twenty percent down to begin with and not have to worry about it but very small fee to get into a home,1,AggyS1coOb8
